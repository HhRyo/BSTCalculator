Project Description: This program is used to take a list that is provided within a text file and then form a binarySearch tree with those values. Afterwards, the user is then prompted and given freedom on how they want to interact with the tree using the commands that will be provided in step 3. 

1. In order to compile the program, please enter the following command: 

$ javac BinarySearchTree.java BinarySearchTreeDriver.java NodeType.java



2. After compiling the program, please follow the format below. You need a text file to work with the program: 

$ java BinarySearchTreeDriver.java [add text file name here]



3. From here, you will have several options to choose from. First clarify if the list within your text file is either that of int values (value 'i'), double values (value 'd'), or string values (value 's'). After, you will be prompted with a list of several options that allow you to interact with the newly formed binary search tree. Below are the following options:

Commands:
(i) - Insert Item
(d) - Delete Item
(p) - Print Tree
(s) - Search Item
(l) - Count Leaf Nodes
(sp) - Find Single Parents
(c) - Find Cousins
(q) - Quit program

The program will continue until the letter 'q' is entered when prompted.
